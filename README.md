# Overview

Here is the repository that contains all materials for the ML systems attached to the VoX Wallet.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

- Download Python 3.6

In each folder where coding is required there should be a requirements file present.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## AWS Framework

## Development

Provides the material for all development of the core Machine Learning systems underlying the service. The folder is sub-divided into the seperate development stages of the service. They include help files or cheat sheets to benefit the developer and without needed resarch.

### Data Collection

### Machine Learning Techniques

Files containing the different machine learning techniques that are tested against each other. Provides the samples that can be used once data is highly available.

### CLI Commands

Provides a list of useful CLI commands needed for development.

## Built With
