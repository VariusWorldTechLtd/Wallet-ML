Provides the material for all development of the core Machine Learning systems underlying the service. The folder is sub-divided into the seperate development stages of the service. They include help files or cheat sheets to benefit the developer and without needed resarch.

### Machine Learning Techniques

Files containing the different machine learning techniques that are tested against each other. Provides the samples that can be used once data is highly available.

### CLI Commands

Provides a list of useful CLI commands needed for development.
