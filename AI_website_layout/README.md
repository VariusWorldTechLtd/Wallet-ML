## Analytics

Varius World Tech wants to provide its users with an analytics dashboard that displays all of their gambling behaviour data. We believe it is fair to open data accessability to the user as well as the operator.

## Machine Learning

We believe there is huge potential for machine learning within the gambling industry. We split machine learning into the following use cases:

- Spotting and intervening problem gamblers
- Gaining marketing insights for player retention

### Problem Gamblers

Using machine learning we can group users into risk group categories. This will enable us to better intervene when customers are becoming a risk.

We can split this machine learning process into two methods:

- Before Initial Deposit
- While Gambling

#### Before Initial Deposit

We can use machine learning to predict problem gambling risk of a user based on demographic and financial data. This gives the potential to put restrictions in place before the user has a chance to commit any financial harm.

#### While Gambling

Most obviously, monitoring gambling behaviour can produce insights in the risk of a user.

### Market Insights

Once we have highlighted and seperated the risky gamblers, machine learning can act to enhance the player retention of non-problem gamblers.
